## 💡 Why This Guide?

Unlike basic Q&A lists, this handbook is designed by senior engineers for engineers. We don't just provide answers; we provide **architectural context**, **performance considerations**, and **real-world implementation patterns**.

### What's Inside:
- 🏗️ **Deep-Dive Architecture**: Bridge vs JSI, TurboModules, Fabric.
- ⚡ **Performance Mastery**: Memory management, 60fps animations, bundle optimization.
- 🔐 **Senior Strategy**: Security best practices and Portfolio Defense.
- 🪤 **Trap Detection**: Identify and avoid common "Follow-up Traps" set by interviewers.

## 🗺️ Interview Preparation Roadmap

The journey is divided into 12 strategic phases. **We recommend following the order** as it builds from low-level architecture to high-level system design.

| Phase | Topic | Focus Area | Status |
|:---:|---|---|:---:|
| 01 | [**Core Fundamentals**](phases/phase1-core-fundamentals.md) | JSI, Bridge, Fabric, Hermes | ✅ |
| 02 | [**React & Hooks**](phases/phase2-react-fundamentals.md) | Hooks Mastery, Lifecycle, Re-renders | ✅ |
| 03 | [**Navigation**](phases/phase3-navigation-architecture.md) | Auth Flows, Deep Linking, Nesting | ✅ |
| 04 | [**Performance**](phases/phase4-performance-memory.md) | Profiling, Memory Leaks, List Opt. | ✅ |
| 05 | [**Native Modules**](phases/phase5-native-modules-apis.md) | TurboModules, Bridge, Codegen | ✅ |
| 06 | [**Testing & CI/CD**](phases/phase6-testing-deployment.md) | Jest, Detox, Fastlane, Pipelines | ✅ |
| 07 | [**Styling & UI**](phases/phase7-styling-ui.md) | Design Systems, Responsive Layouts | ✅ |
| 08 | [**State Management**](phases/phase8-state-management.md) | Redux Toolkit, Zustand, Context | ✅ |

| 10 | [**Security & Privacy**](phases/phase10-security-best-practices.md) | Keychain, SSL Pinning, Obfuscation | ✅ |
| 11 | [**Advanced Patterns**](phases/phase11-advanced-patterns.md) | HOCs, Render Props, Micro-frontends | ✅ |
| 12 | [**Portfolio Defense**](phases/phase12-portfolio-defense.md) | System Design, Soft Skills | ✅ |

## 🛠️ How to Use This Guide

### 1. The "Out Loud" Technique
Don't just read. When you see a **Question**, pause and answer it out loud before checking the **Perfect Answer Structure**.

### 2. Study the "Follow-up Traps"
Interviewers often use a follow-up to see if you actually understand the concept or just memorized a definition. These sections prepare you for the "Why?" and "When?"

### 3. Analyze Code Snippets
All code examples are **Production-Ready**. Don't just look at them—understand why `useCallback` or `useMemo` was used in that specific context.

## 📈 Next Steps

- [ ] Star this repository for quick access during preparation.
- [ ] Implement the **Custom API Hook** from Phase 2 in a side project.
- [ ] Review **Phase 12** at least 48 hours before your interview.
